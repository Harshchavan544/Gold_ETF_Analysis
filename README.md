# Gold_ETF_Analysis

In this project, I analyzed the relationship between Gold ETFs, actual gold prices, and the Sensex Index to understand how different financial assets interact over time.

This project helped me apply data analysis techniques to real-world financial data and gain a deeper understanding of how investment assets move in relation to one another.
